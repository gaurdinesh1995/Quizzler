## Our Goal

The goal of this app is to take one step further in my journey of becoming an app developer. I am going to introduce you to the holy grail of mobile design patterns: the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A design pattern is simply a repeatable and optimised solution to a common software problem and youâ€™ll learn more about this when use in the tutorial.

## What I will create

I will program a trivia quiz app.
